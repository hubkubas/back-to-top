# back-to-top button - working :)
This is the script I am using on all my pages, it's working and it's very simple to modify.
There are three files included here: index.html, custom css, my.js

Index.html

this is a demo index.html just to show that it's working. This is the button line with the tooltip. You can write as a tooltip title what ever You want to be produced when hover on the button.
   

custom.css - there is css of the included button. You can define it as You want.
       
my.js - the script file, please remember to include jquery in Your index.html.

Working button can be seen here on one of my pages - <a href="http://rekrutacja.it">rekrutacja it</a>
